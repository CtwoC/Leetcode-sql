-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- | IT         | Max      | 90000  |

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE(
    (e.DepartmentId, Salary) IN
    (SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
     FROM Employee
     GROUP BY DepartmentId)
)
#TIP: 1.Select highest salary of each department id from employee database using group by and max function
#2.The use of where and in
